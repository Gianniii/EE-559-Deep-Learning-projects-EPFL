# EE-559-Deep-Learning-projects-EPFL

This repository contains the two miniprojects performed in the scope of the Deep Learning class - EE-559 at EPFL.

The description of the projects can be found in `MiniProjectsDescription.pdf`

## Project 1
The objective of this project is to design and test different architectures in Pytorch, in order to compare two digits visible
in a two-channel image. It aims at showing in particular the impact of weight sharing, and of the use of an auxiliary loss to help the training of the main objective.

Our code can be found in: `miniproject1` folder

## Project 2
In order to gain a better appreciation of the comfort granted to us by libraries such as pytorch, for the second mini-project we implement some of the modules on our own. Using only pre-made functions for matrix operations and data helpers.
Overall, we have implemented a module to combine layers as well as different activation functions and loss criteria, which apply forward and backward passes
seamlessly.
